gameplay
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

general physics:
    - constraints (particlarly cone twist and hinge constraints)
    - explosions (ghost object + ray casts?) (sphere + contact iteration?)

vehicles:
    - constraints (particularly hinge constraint for car doors)
    - study handling.cfg
    - extract graphics and collision meshes from gta vehicles
    - make the bike bank properly

actors:
    - constraints for ragdoll (particlarly cone twist and hinge constraints)
    - extract actor models
    - extract skeleton data
    - lua bindings for hardware animation
    - study bullet character controller
    - play with capsule

weather (caelum? needs cg)

sea water (hydrax? needs cg too)

other water

foilage

skid marks

sparks

smoke from behind car

performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

set up a timeDemo simulation for quantative performance measurements

binary collision file format
binary contains precomputed data for bvh-based collision meshes

Collision meshes to be considered a resource like graphical meshes

rigid body creation triggers creation of CollisionMesh instance if not already
existing

rigid body creation triggers loading of CollisionMesh instance if not already loaded

background resource loading includes collision meshes

display the occl zones, find out if i can use them for occlusion culling

might be able to do my own tests with some triangles or axis-aligned quads.
make sure that from all angles, all objects whose centres lie behind the quads
are fully occluded.  alternatively check all 8 corners of the aabb of the
object being rendered (better as it's only slow in the occluded case where we
make a saving)

minimising the number of occl zones is very important for performance
(obviously)

write windows gdi thingy for stdout ("rich text")
